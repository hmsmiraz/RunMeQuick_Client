# RunMeQuick

- For run this locally we have to clone the repository also RunMeQuick_Server rrepository,then we need to install npm and we need to add (.env.local) for client repository (.env) file for backend repository whose I provided by email. After this we can run the file locally- npm run dev for frontend and nodemon index.js for backend.
